      <h1 class="titulo">FAQ</h1>
      <dl class="faq-lista" data-anime="accordion">
        <dt>What do these animals - the fox, penguin, wolf, eagle, squirrel, and bear - have in common?</dt>
      <dd>Despite their differences in habitats, diets, and behaviors, these animals share some fascinating 
        commonalities. They all exhibit exceptional adaptability, thriving in various environments across the 
        globe, from the cold Arctic tundra to the heat of the desert and even bustling urban environments. 
        They also display complex social or communication behaviors - wolves in their pack dynamics, squirrels 
        in their communal food gathering, penguins in their huddling and parenting, bears in their maternal care, 
        and foxes and eagles in their expressive vocalizations and signals. These shared traits underscore their 
        resilience, intelligence, and the intricate balance of life in the animal kingdom.</dd>
      <dt>What are some notable survival strategies used by these animals?</dt>
      <dd>Each of these animals has developed unique survival strategies over time. For instance, bears hibernate 
        during winter, lowering their body temperature and slowing their metabolism to conserve energy. Similarly, 
        squirrels gather and store food in the warmer months to survive the colder months. Penguins huddle 
        together in colonies to withstand the harsh Antarctic weather, and foxes use their acute hearing and 
        stealth to hunt effectively. Eagles use their superior vision and flight speed to spot and capture prey, 
        while wolves work in coordinated packs to bring down larger prey.</dd>
      <dt>How have these animals adapted to urban environments?</dt>
      <dd>Certain species of these animals, like foxes and squirrels, have shown a remarkable ability to adapt 
        to urban environments. Foxes have been known to forage for food in city trash bins and gardens, and some 
        even live in dens built in urban parks. Squirrels thrive in city parks and backyards, where they can 
        easily find food and nesting spots. On the other hand, urban environments pose significant challenges 
        for animals like bears, wolves, and eagles, leading to conflicts and conservation concerns.</dd>
      <dt>Are these animals endangered?</dt>
      <dd>The conservation status of these animals varies. While some species or populations of bears, wolves, 
        and eagles are considered endangered or threatened due to habitat loss, hunting, and pollution, others 
        are thriving. Penguins are also facing threats from climate change, overfishing, and habitat disturbance,
         with several species classified as vulnerable or endangered. Foxes and squirrels are generally abundant,
          but certain species or populations may face local threats.</dd>
      <dt>Why are these animals important to their ecosystems?</dt>
      <dd>Each of these animals plays a critical role in their ecosystem. Wolves, as apex predators, help control
         the population of herbivores, which in turn maintains the health of vegetation. Bears and squirrels aid 
         in seed dispersal, contributing to forest regeneration. Eagles also act as top predators and help 
         control populations of small mammals and fish. Penguins contribute to nutrient cycling in their 
         Antarctic ecosystem, and their population status can be an indicator of ocean health. Foxes control 
         rodent and rabbit populations and their burrows provide shelter for other species. In this way, each 
         animal contributes to the biodiversity and stability of their ecosystem.</dd>
